# Hello! I'm Fábio Lima
<sub>*Always Developing
 Like a Data Scientist*</sub>

Graduated in Civil Engineering from UNIP, I worked for a few years as a construction manager, but the flame of innovation always attracted me, with this purpose I dived into the world of entrepreneurship with an E-commerce where I could learn a lot about digital marketing, online sales, management tools, paid traffic and administration and processes of a company. I worked for a while as a provider of paid traffic services for other companies and with that aroused my great interest in learning Data Science and falling headlong into the technology area. Today I study constantly and I aim to work in the data area. I am studying DATA EXPERT – Data Science and Machine Learning at DNC with the aim of making this career transition and developing myself more and more in the data area.<br>
<br>
All my experience as an engineer, manager and entrepreneur was valid and brought me a lot of learning, combined with analytical skills, ability to work in team environments, adaptability and fast learning with great attention to detail.

**My Knowledge in:** Python, Machine Learning, Space Operations and Mathematical Optimisation.
